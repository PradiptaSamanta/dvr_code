Here are some instructions to compile and run the code in the 'all_in_one' branch

To compile: here are the steps
1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake ..
4) make -j6 arpack
5) make -j6
The compiled binary 'dvr' will be found inside the 'build' directory

To run a test calculation, the necessary input file 'dvr.inp' can be found inside the 'test' directory. 
Output from this calculation will be written out in  the file 'dvr.out'.
